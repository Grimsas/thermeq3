### 2016-Apr-08
* to use "current" temperature for loggging find out this text `# comment line below to use current temp` in nsm.py (for V1xx) or in thermeq3.py (for V2xx) and follow 
instructions. Please keep in mind, that current temperature on heater thermostat can be 0.0 (zero) because of limitations of HT!

* Implemented support for day table, just enable beta functionality (thermeq3.ip/data/put/beta/yes) and edit table in nsm.py. You can control boiler in different way during day.

# Thats all folks. Stay tuned :)
